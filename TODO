- [ ] Handle out file argument (for different stages)
- [ ] Handle arguments for which compilation step to stop at (assembly output, linker output etc.)
- [ ] Add a few tests (find some way to test code coverage maybe?)
- [ ] Compiler to some IR. Could be basic blocks or some other even more basic assembly IR so we can output to multiple platforms more easily
- [ ] Add support for windows (and MacOS?)
